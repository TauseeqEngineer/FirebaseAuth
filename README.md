# Firebase Email/Password Authentication

This project demonstrates how to implement **Firebase Authentication** for **user registration** and **login** using **Email and Password** in an Android app. The app allows users to create an account, log in, and handle user authentication using Firebase's built-in authentication methods.



## Features

- **User Registration**:  
  Allows users to sign up using their email and password. Firebase automatically validates the registration and handles account creation.

- **User Login**:  
  Users can log in with their registered email and password. Firebase authentication is used to validate user credentials.

- **Error Handling**:  
  Displays appropriate error messages for invalid credentials, missing fields, or issues during the registration/login process.

- **Session Management**:  
  Automatically manages user sessions using Firebase Authentication. Redirects the user to the main screen once logged in successfully.
